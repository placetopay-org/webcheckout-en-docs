  version: '1.0'
  description: "With WebCheckout your site gets a URL to which your user will be redirected to perform the transactional process. In this way, you avoid catching sensitive information and definition for an interface of payment process.\n\nWebcheckout API is based on REST, returns answers with JSON coding. To make use of this service it is necessary that your site connect using Version 1.2 of TLS.\n\nYou can use the WebCheckout API in test mode, which does not interact with banking networks. Depending on the endpoint used in the application determines whether it is in productive mode or in test mode.\n\n* Test mode: https://test.placetopay.com/redirection/api/session/\n* Productive mode: https://checkout.placetopay.com\n\n### Considerations:\n\n* The URL is needed where data will be sent by using post (endpoint) method.\n\n* JSON should be used for sending authentication parameters, payment information and control data.\n\n* Expiration time (expiration) must be a valid date in ISO 8601 format, indicates time limit that the user has to make payment and must be at least 5 minutes higher than current date.\n\n**Important**: The expiration is the maximum time given for the session, if a user does not perform the operation, the session is pending until expiration.\n\n* The return URL (Returnurl) is used to redirect the user once the operation is finished. It is recommended to sea data to the URL with which the site can identify the record for example: https://mysite.com/response/ireference}. \n\n* Configure a notification URL on your server using ports 80 or 443 and in case the payment is decline or approved,receive a notification by post as an asynchronous way.\n\n**Important**: This notification URL must be supplied to Placetopay for its configuration.\n\n### PROCESS OF INTEGRATION\n\n1. At the moment, user proceed with operation on your site, you must consume the createrequest method.\n2. If the request is processed correctly, the service creates a session and returns an answer:\n\n* `Requestid` identifier\n* `ProcessUrl` Processing Url\n\n3. Create a record in your system, it relates that record to the Requestid and grants a pending status.\n4.\tIt redirects the user to the processurl obtained in point 2.\n5.\tIn Web Checkout interface, the user going to make the payment or subscription process where the information must be filled to process payment.\n6.\tSubsequently, the user must select payment method which the purchase will be added by entering data from payment method.\n7.\tOnce user performs the process and click on \"Return to commerce\", it is sent to the Returnurl return URL (specified attribute when creating a\t operation).\n8.\tBack to commerce, with RequestiD registred you must consult placetopay the status of the session using the GetRequestInformation method.\n9.\tRun your business rule according to status obtained, to update status of it in your database.\n10.\tAsynchronously, Placetopay performs a notification, final status of a session, to your site.\n11.\tWe recommend implement a probe process to resolve those transactions that were not resolved at sections 7 and 9.\n\n**Checkout Web Interface Methods**\n\nWeb Service contains different methods where use request - response type operations are executed, these require for each one, income parameters that are used by data structures, which information is processed to subsequently return a response. \n \n If you want to run a method, you can quickly use any of them on the left and simulate it on  right side of documentation."

        | Parameter | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | Login | Site identifier. |
        | tranKey | transactional key, which consists of the following operation: Base64(SHA-1(nonce + seed + secretkey)). Nonce within operation is the original, that is, the one that is not in Base64. |
        | nonce | Random value for each Base64-encoded request. |
        | seed | Current date, which is generated in ISO 8601 format. |

        `Login and secretKey are provided by PlacetoPay`

        `This structure must be sent in each request made to the service`

        `The seed can't make a difference of more than 5 minutes.`

        **Errors**

        Web CheckOut service returns a response codes for failed authentication in message attribute of status object.

        | Code| Cause |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | 100 | UsernameToken not provided (Malformed Authorization Header). |
        | 101 | Site IDENTIFIER does not exist (Incorrect login or not in the environment). |
        | 102 | TranKey hash does not match (wrong or poorly formed Trankey). |

        | 105 | Site expired. |
        | 106 | Expired credentials. |
        | 107 | UsernameToken wrong definition (Does not fulfill with WSSE header). |
        | 200 | Skip the SOAP authentication header. |
        |  10001 | Contact Support. |

        **Frequent errors**

        Error message `Authentication badly formed`

        It is presented when the system does not detect that Login, Trankey, Seed or Nonce is being sent in the AUTH structure sent, it can also be presented if these data are sent but incorrectly, without the Content-Type "Application / JSON" parameter " So the server interprets the request as text instead of a array data.

        Your servers require TLSv1.2 to receive the request, due to the PCI standard. Please check encryption and protocol used to connect to server. If you use Java, keep in mind that only versions after 8 have full support.

        SoapFault responds with the message  `Authentication Failed 103`

        Authentication process we reviewed Created field, this field must be in GMT time or local time using the zone time. If you get this answer, it is because your time is not accurate with real time. We only allow 5 minutes of difference between time. You can use NTP to maintain the precision of the clock.
        Keep in mind that base64 should be for RAW OUTPUT of SHA1 and according to all programming languages this may be required to configure this option, for example. In php base64_encode (Sha1 (..., true)) this parameter would return RAW OUTPUT for the `SHA1 algorithm.`

        On the right side of this site, can simulate generation of authentication required for each of requests made to Payment Gateway (WebCheckout), said method receives a login and trankey via POST request, internally processing is performed From the information to return a JSON structure that can be copied and stuck in other requests within AUTH object.

        It should be noted that this method is provided as an aid to generate the authentication structure of the requests and does not part of the webcheckout integration method

        The subscription allows you to securely store (tokenized) a user's payment method, so that they can then make charges related to it. To make use of this functionality it is necessary to send  subscription structure in the RedirectRequest, which requests the creation of the session (subscription request) and returns the ID and process URL.

        Structure used for the subscription payment method.

        * SubscriptionResponse
        * CollectRequest
        * NameValuePair
        * Token
        * Person
        * Instrument

        **It is recommended to charge a minimum value to identify that the card is active**.

        **Token information must be stored on your site, related to the user and/or product. After you have the token, you can generate charges to the tokenized payment method using the collect method**.

        The response structure contains all the information from the original request and a subscription structure with an instrument (instrument) represented in the form of a token.

        You can simulate the operation taking the following example, placing your authentication on the right side of the page.

        Mixed payment allows you to use multiple payment methods at the time of payment for same session.

        To make use of this functionality, in the payment structure of Payment it is necessary to send the `allowPartial` attribute as: True, additional must be requested in PlacetoPay to enable such functionality in administrative panel.

        **Additional states of a mixed payment session**

        When obtaining the result of the trade, you should keep in mind following two states, since these must be controlling by trade, if user does not finish  payment it must be determined to do if it is reversed or another procedure is done:

        **APPROVED_PARTIAL**: Indicates that at least one approved payment is made but the full session payment is not made.
        **PARTIAL_EXPIRED**: Indicates that at least one approved payment is made but the full session payment has not been completed and the session has expired.

        `It is important to identify according to the site's business rule when obtaining either of these two states`.

        `For mixed payments there are also the other statuses of a normal approved, REJECTED, PENDING, FAILED transaction`

        Information query of a transaction can be given when the user is returned to your site or by a schedule task that daily executes a script in wich all pending operations on your site are consulted.
        Recomendation: Implement both alternatives in your site, because if something fails in the return and notification process, the schedule task can be used as a contingency.
